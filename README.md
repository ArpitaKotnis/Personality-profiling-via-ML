# Personality-profiling-via-ML

 Project Name: "PsyPredictor: Personality Profiling via ML"
Overview:
PsyPredictor is a machine learning pipeline that utilizes Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and K-Means Clustering for behavioral segmentation to predict the Big Five (OCEAN) personality traits of individuals. The model analyzes individual responses to a standardized personality assessment questionnaire along with demographic features, aiming to accurately classify and score personality traits across the Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism spectrum.

 Objectives:
To reduce high-dimensional personality response data using PCA, capturing the most influential psychological components.

To segment behavioral patterns using K-Means clustering to reveal psychological profiles.

To predict OCEAN scores with high accuracy using supervised learning (if extended).

To explore relationships between demographic features and personality clusters.

 Dataset:
Source: Open Psychometrics via Kaggle

Size: 1,015,342 responses

Format: Questionnaire responses (scale 1â€“5) to 50 items (10 per OCEAN trait), plus demographics

Preprocessing steps include normalization, handling missing data, encoding demographics, and response vector construction.

Tech Stack:
Languages/Tools: Python, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

ML Models:

PCA (for dimensionality reduction & visualization)

K-Means Clustering (for grouping users into psychological archetypes)

Optional: Linear Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost (for trait score prediction)

Visualization: Cluster plots, heatmaps of trait correlations, scree plot (PCA variance explained)
